-> Foraging is search of food. The bacteria moves towards nutrients with least use of energy. 
It is an evolutionary algorithm that minimizes the cost with swarm property.

-> There are 4 steps in the process

1) Chemotaxis -> Swim or Tumble
Same direction is swim otherwise tumble. 

2) Swarmig -> All the bacteria has this group unity that help them collectively make descisions for global optimums. They release attractant to signal other bacterua to swarm towards it.

3) In reproduction, half of the unhealthy bacteria die off. Others reproduce.

4) Elimination and dispersion -> To remove the bacteria trapped in local minima, we use this step.


====================================================================

Controllablity -> rank(ctrb(A,B)) has to be 4 = umber of states

If so, we can design u = -Kx so that x_dot = (A-BK)x and then, eig(A-BK) is proper.
