->  x` = Ax + Bu
      y = Cx + Du

-> State Variables are variables that are needed to fully describe and predict the future of the system.
     No of state variables = Order of the system.

-> Pole Placement => Make controller gain as 1 and change the feedback scale factor in order to bring the poles to RHS.
Make the Eigen Values equal to negative and find the gains.

-> Configurations forming 0 ss error
	1) Scaled reference - Here the state is feedbacked and feedback gain is not unity
	2) Steady state error - Here the state is feedbcked and feedback gain is unity but input has a scale factor
	3) Normal Controller with Integral action

-> LQR => In this we follow the same configuration of a pole placement scheme, the only difference is that we solve a assignment
	problem to get the values of K and Kr in a way that we ballance the Cost(performance) and Acuator effort( energy)

The first part is done by integrating the time it takes for the state variables to reach to zero (Thus we integrate it).
The second part is taken care by integrating the Input.
